This project (directory) is the the Ext2 file system implementation from the JNode operating
system (http://www.jnode.org), release 0.2.8, modified to work in the context of Guest VM.

The modifications are very minor, a couple of trivial API changes, and a change from
Apache logging to the Java platform logging API (and the very simple implementation of that
provided by Guest VM). In addition actual logging has been made conditional on the current level
to avoid generating the data when the logging will not occur.

Of 64 files copied from JNode, 22 were modified, and are clearly annotated to that effect
with the Sun copyright. The modified files are licensed under GPL utilizing the upgrade option
for combined works from LGPL to GPL.

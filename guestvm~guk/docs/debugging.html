<H1>GUK: Debugging</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>

GUK supports two debugging mechanisms, interactive debugging
from a separate domain, and trace generation for situations where interactive debugging is
either inappropriate or impractical.

<H2>Debugging</H2>
At the beginning of the project there was no support within the Xen world for
one domain to debug another, as is normal in the Unix process world, e.g. gdb.
There has been some progress in this direction lately, from Oracle, but
the support is not yet part of the standard distribution.
<p>
The <a href="http://labs.oracle.com/projects/maxine">Maxine VM</a>
provides a powerful GUI-based debugger, the Inspector, that supports
Maxine development. The Inspector uses similar low-level facilities to
gdb, e.g., ptrace on Unix systems. It was decided to port the
Inspector to the Virtual Edition by providing explicit support in the
microkernel for the features required by the Inspector, by
implementing a a custom frontend/backend driver using the Xen ring
communication mechanism.

<H3>Implementation Details</H3>

GUK communicates with the debugger via a ring.  The debugger puts
requests on the ring and a debug threads collects the requests and parses
them. GUK supports 16 types of requests, defined in tools/db-front/dbif.h:

<pre>
<code>
REQ_READ_U64           /* read a word from a specified address */
REQ_WRITE_U64          /* write a word to a specified address */
REQ_GATHER_THREAD      /* get a the thread id and its flags */
REQ_SUSPEND_THREAD     /* suspend a specified thread */
REQ_RESUME_THREAD      /* resume a previous suspended thread */
REQ_SINGLE_STEP_THREAD /* request to single step a thread */
REQ_GET_REGS           /* get the register contents of a thread */
REQ_SET_IP             /* set the instruction pointer of a thread */
REQ_GET_THREAD_STACK   /* get the address of a thread */
REQ_APP_SPECIFIC1      /* weak symbol, not used in GUK */
REQ_READBYTES  /* read a number of bytes starting at a specified address */
REQ_WRITEBYTES /* write bytes starting at a specified address */
REQ_DB_DEBUG           /* set the debug level for the DEBUG statements */
REQ_SIGNOFF            /* request to shutdown a debug connectionn */
REQ_SUSPEND_THREADS    /* not used */
</code>
</pre>

The read and write operations (i.e. READ_U64, WRITE_U64, READBYTES, and
WRITEBYTES) could result in a page fault.  And the page fault handler has
to be aware that the debugger initiated the memory access.  When the page
fault handler notices a fault initiated by the debugger, it notifies the
debug thread, which recovers from the error and responds with an error to
the debugger.
<p>
The low-level debug implementation uses two trap.  The debug trap (int1) is
used for single stepping, and the int3 trap is used for breakpoints.  If a
thread is marked for single stepping it will suspend at specific points: on
return from an interrupt in preempt_schedule_irq or when preempted in
preempt_schedule.  The debugger can savely read the thread's registers only
if it is suspended in these states, since the interrupt mechanism and the
preemption mechanism save a threads register contents on its stack, and the
thread itself is blocked.  However, single stepping does not work correctly
for the very first step if initiated from preemption code path, since the
threads rflag register is restored only on return from interrupt.
Therefore, the thread activates single stepping after the schedule
invokation returns, but before it resumes execution. Thus the first
stepping interrupt is probably still in the scheduler code. However,
beginning with the second step interrupts occur in the code of the debugged
thread.

<H2>Tracing</H2>

The original Mini-OS code contained a mechanism for debugging via tracing based on DEBUG macros
that were conditionally compiled.
Some of this still remains, but much of it has been replaced by a permanent tracing mechanism
that is per-subsystem and can be selectively enabled by runtime command line options.
<p>
Part of the rationale for the new tracing system was to support off-line analysis
of the system, for example, the memory management system or the scheduler.
Therefore the tracing is oriented to machine analysis rather then human readibility.
<p>
The following subsystems can be traced; the trace option is in brackets:
<pre>
</pre>
scheduler             (sched)
domain startup        (startup)
blk device            (blk)
debugging back-end    (dbback)
sibling file system   (fsfront)
grant tables          (gnttab)
memory management     (mm)
page table management (mmpt)
network device        (net)
services              (service)
multiple cpus         (smp)
xenbus                (xenbus)
trap handling         (traps)

</pre>
Tracing is enabled by adding <code>-XX:GUKTrace:T</code> the "extra" command line 
where <code>T</code> is a list of the above options separated by ":". E.g.,

<pre>
xm config -c domain-config extra=-XX:GUKTrace:startup:mmpt
</pre>
This would trace domain startup and page table handling sending the
trace output to the Xen console. To send trace output to the domain
console, set the trace option <code>toring</code>.  By default output
is unbuffered, i.e, it will interleave with program output. By setting
the option <code>buffer</code>, output will be buffered until the
domain exits. Note that the buffer is fixed size, so buffered output
may wrap; this is indicated in the output. Note also that buffered
output is less intrusive to the domain than non-buffered as it holds no spinlocks
and does not disable events while generating the data.
E.g.
<pre>
xm config -c domain-config extra=-XX:GUKTrace:startup:mmpt:toring:buffer
</pre>
<H3>Reserved CPU Tracing</H3>
As an experimental feature, it is possible to dedicate a CPU to tracing some event of interest,
e.g., printing the run queue periodically, without interfering with the activities of the other
CPUs. The tracing CPU runs a special idle thread that executes the <code>guk_trace_cpu_fn</code>
every second. GUK provides a weak definition of <code>guk_trace_cpu_fn</code> that does nothing. An encapsulating system can enable tracing by providing a strong definition and linking it with GUK. 
The CPU reservation is enabled with the <code>-XX:GUKCT=N</code> option, to reserve CPU <code>N</code>, where <code>N > 0</code>.

<H1>GUK: Introduction/H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
This documentation describes the guest VM microkernel, GUK for short,
which is an evolution of the Xen Minimal OS, Mini-OS. GUK was designed initially to
support the Virtual edition of the 
<a href="http://labs.oracle.com/projects/maxine">Maxine virtual machine</a> and, therefore, 
although more functional than Mini-OS, it is also somewhat more specialized.
However, GUK should be usable in a wide variety of environments,
particularly in the support of language run time virtual machines.
<p>
The main differences between Mini-OS, when originally forked, and GUK are:
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple VCPUS (SMP)
<li>Pre-emptive thread scheduling
<li>Memory management tailored to a language run time virtual machine
<li>Memory ballooning
<li>Block device support
<li>Suspend/Resume support
</ul>
Note that Mini-OS has also evolved since the fork and it would be good to 
merge bug fixes and new features as appropriate.

GUK
====

GUK is a derivative of the Xen Minimal OS (Mini-OS) that is used to
support the Maxine VM, Virtual Edition. It can be run stand-alone,
although there is some code that assumes that it is supporting Maxine,
or at least a JVM.

It requires a 64-bit x86 machine and hypervisor.

Building
========

Set the environment variable XEN_ROOT to the root of your Xen distribution
and then execute gmake.

The debugging support and file-system support via sibling Linux guest
are in tools/db-front and tools/fs-back, respectively. There are not
built by default as they must be built on Linux and installed in the
Linux guest in which they will execute.

Running
=======

To start it do the following in domain0 (assuming xend is running)

# xm create -c domain_config

This starts the kernel and then once every second prints the system time.

If the environment variable BRIDGE is set to the name of the network bridge
then incoming network packets are also reported on the console.

License
=======

GUK is licensed under GPL V2.

More Info
=========

More documentation can be found in the "docs" directory.
